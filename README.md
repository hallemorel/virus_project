    - As part of a larger project I created an interactive map to showcase the breakdown of where countries across the world fall on a scale of Low, Medium or High for death rates in terms of pandemics. This was to include in a project with other research comparing the history of pandemics to the most recent COVID-19 pandemic.
    
    - In order to create the interactive map I used HTML, CSS, and the leaflet library in order to create a local host website.
